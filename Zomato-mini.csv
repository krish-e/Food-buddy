Quite a pocket friendly place, empire is - always. Buffet for 199, isn't that a great deal? The taste and quantity is authentic based on the price tag attached to them. The buffet spread remains same as is from ages and no change in variety or taste. The coke served was not chilled one, and the staff hesitated to even answer when we asked them to serve a chilled one. So 1 start less for that. Ambience was good enough for a buffet. The sweet was not tasty.\n\nAnd along with buffet, we tried tawa fry pomfret which was too bad. We didn't dare to order anything more after we were disappointed with that. So 2 stars less for this.\n\nAnyways this huge chain is visitable once in a while.
